#### SOLUTION 
##### Challenge 1 Warmup (PIXEL DUST)

1. Strings the file 
2. The last bit contains `TELEVISION` some sort of string, just google the actual entire string and you will find a very old image file extension `.tga` . 
3. Next thing is to find the magic number (header) of that file extension
4. Open the file in hex editor 
5. Just change the first byte you got from search
6. Open the file in image viewer and get the flag
